        <div class="text">
            <p>In something of an "emergency" measure, the provincial government of Alberta recently cut 7%, or about $56 million, from the funding allocated to the university that I attend. Naturally, this has prompted plenty of discussion from media pundits as well as lighter conversation in social circles. As such, I've noticed a disturbing misconception put forward by a few people, who seemingly have never attended a post-secondary institution.</p>
<p>First, they assume, a priori, that there is some nebulous and ill-defined, yet completely obvious, problem with the post-secondary education system. Second, they assert that merely slashing the budget will somehow magically force a reform of the entire system, and cure everything that ails us. This line of argument often centres around perceived "inefficiencies" asserted to exist simply because we Canadians have thus far had the audacity to, you know, not privatize the system.</p>
<p>Closely related to this line of thinking are the people who argue that simply moving all courses online, a la <a href="http://www.udacity.com" target="_blank">Udacity</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a>, will solve any and all educational issues. I've participated in some of these massively online courses and certainly couldn't detect an increase in the quality of instruction or educational outcomes (quite the contrary, in fact) but I will concede that simply moving all the lectures to YouTube will indeed solve the funding problem.</p>
<p>So what, then, is actually the problem with our undergraduate education system?</p>
<p><p><span id='continue'></span></p></p>
<p>Easy. <strong>Universities don't employ teachers.</strong> Consider that for a moment. The institution where you will send your kids, at great expense, to get a gold-plated education in their field of interest does not find it necessary to include educators in that process. (The singular exception to this is if you happen to be enrolled in the Faculty of Education, in which case most of your professors and instructors may very well be educators, but these students are a small minority on campus.)</p>
<p>This policy has serious impacts on student learning. Just think for a moment: the professor that teaches introductory Calculus (or Biology, Physics, English, or any other subject) to your 18-year-old is not qualified to teach your high-school, junior-high, or elementary school-aged children anything. He may have a Ph.D. but he couldn't get an entry-level position teaching in any K-12 school in the province.</p>
<p>As it happens, trainee teachers learn all kinds of wonderful stuff about how to go about the work of teaching things to other people, including topics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educational psychology</li>
<li>Childhood development</li>
<li>Lesson planning (imagine: a college professor with a lesson plan!)</li>
<li>Theoretical models of curricula</li>
<li>Leadership</li>
<li>Change management</li>
<li>How to help students with learning disabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>and other things, I'm sure. Teachers also get a good balance of classroom-based theory and vocational-style training where they operate a classroom under the guidance and supervision of an experienced teacher. It doesn't take much imagination to realize that these types of things make teachers much more skilled at educating students than a random sample of people from the general population. Also consider that professors, particularly in the <acronym title="Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics">STEM</acronym> fields, tend not to be (how can I say this?)... neuro-typical. That is, it takes a certain kind of person to slog through a Ph.D. program in science or math, and that person may or may not be more qualified at teaching than the general public.</p>
<p>Next, consider that there are very few undergraduate courses that really require the in-depth domain knowledge of a post-doctorate-level professor (certainly not any course below 400-level). In fact, I can't think of any course, off the top of my head, that couldn't be taught by a teacher who majored in the given field (eg. a teacher who majored in English should be able to teach any English course up to at least 300-level; a teacher who majored in mathematics should be able to teach any mathematics course up to at least 300-level).</p>
<p>Even more galling is the fact that the university administration doesn't seem to think it necessary to provide professors with any teaching resources to speak of. I can't guarantee that this is a universal situation, but I've had several professors in the departments of Mathematics and Computing Science tell me that they can't put their course notes online, because they haven't prepared the notes yet! How is that even possible? Even if the professor is teaching a course for the first time, the department of Mathematics has been teaching, for example, "MATH114 Introduction to Calculus 1" for decades, so why doesn't the department have lesson resources already prepared? Not only is this insanity, but it's a waste of money for the institution and a waste of time for the students; the professor's time would be better spent on research (you know, that stuff the university is <em>actually</em> mandated to do) and the students would be better served by a program that was adequately resourced. Moreover, this ridiculous routine is repeated not once a year, but up to four times each year, depending on the popularity of the course (Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer semesters).</p>
<p>Perhaps I'm too close to the problem since I'm both a student and a software developer with a decade of industry experience, but it seems to me that every university in Canada has the resources to install some sort of document management solution and post a few PDFs for each of the classes they offer in a given year. Although the department would have to allocate resources to prepare the notes and maintain them, in the long run having shared course resources would be a lot less costly than having each professor prepare a unique set of notes for each class they teach and hopefully the resources would end up being of much higher quality, overall.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, my wife is a secondary school teacher and she's told me that a very interesting thing happens at her school: the teachers share resources and help each other prepare activities! Shocking! In addition to sites like <a title="Free and log-cost education resources" href="http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/" target="_blank">Teachers Pay Teachers</a>, it is common practice for more experienced educators to give lesson plans and resources to their less-experienced colleagues, thus easing the burden of teaching a course for the first time. They also have regular department meetings where they coordinate their activities, plan upcoming activities, and generally keep on the same page about their approach to the curriculum. Perhaps university professors seem to have trouble understanding this because they've spent their adult lives in the world of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish" target="_blank">Publish or Perish</a>".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this all seems to be naive thinking. Rather than downloading the notes, reading them in advance, then showing up at the lecture prepared to focus, think critically, and ask clarifying questions, students are forced into what must be the least efficient method of data transfer known to mankind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assemble anywhere from 80 to 400 students in a room</li>
<li>Place a professor at the front of the room.</li>
<li>When the class starts, have the professor manually copy his notes from the sheaf of dog-eared and hastily scribbled notes in his hand onto the whiteboard in 6 point font, using a faint and nearly empty dry-erase marker</li>
<li>While the professor is doing that, have each of the students frantically attempt to read, interpret, and hastily scribble the notes into their own sheaf of dog-eared, but blank, papers</li>
<li>At the end of class, dismiss everyone, having learned nothing (except perhaps the value of shorthand)</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat as needed</li>
</ul>
<p>With this algorithm in place, it becomes more obvious why experienced students will tell you that learning happens alone at home and through hard work, not thanks to anything substantial the university has done in return for your dollars.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the only sensible school reformer I've come across is Sal Khan, founder of <a title="Khan Academy" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>. Rather than suggesting that we can replace teachers with YouTube videos and classes of 100,000 students, Khan has the much more rational view that <strong>students should read notes and watch lectures as homework, freeing up class time to work interactively with their teacher on problem sets</strong>, writing exercises, and other participatory activities that contribute directly to learning. Of course, if a student is having trouble with a problem set, there is a highly skilled adult ready and able to help, which is almost certainly not the general case when students work on problem sets as homework (at any level of education). This idea, of course, meshes nicely with the way universities used to work: more like an apprentice program where the professor, rather than simply giving lectures, would closely mentor the student for several years in a largely one-on-one relationship.</p>
<p>Of course at the university level, Khan's ideas are more like dreams since they clash with several realities of the current post-secondary institutional system. For one thing, scrambling to implement massive budget cuts in just a couple of months probably doesn't create an atmosphere of thoughtful outside-the-box thinking that one would prefer when tackling such a reformation. Add to that the fact that the university doesn't seem to be aware of the current problems and you've got a recipe for the status quo. For these, and other, reasons I suppose that I will probably not have the privilege of studying in a university that employs real teachers and turns the lecture format upside-down, but here's hoping that we still make the necessary changes at some point.</p>
<p><strong>Update Sep 10, 2013:</strong></p>
<p>It's unusual for me to write a blog post, and then immediately come across new evidence supporting my argument, but <a href="http://freakonomics.com/2013/09/10/are-tenured-professors-better-classroom-teachers/">this week it happened</a>. A gem from the linked article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...maybe classroom instruction isn't a highly-sought-after trait among tenured professors."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe indeed.</p>
